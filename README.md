This repository demonstrates a common C++ error: dereferencing a null pointer. The `bug.cpp` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to write to a memory location that hasn't been allocated. This leads to undefined behavior, often resulting in a segmentation fault (crash) during runtime. The `bugSolution.cpp` file shows the corrected code, using proper null pointer checks to prevent the error.
